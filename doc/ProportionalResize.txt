DESCRIPTION				      *ProportionalResize-description*

When Vim itself is resized, the rightmost and bottom windows receive or lose
the change in size; all other windows maintain their size as long as possible.
What you usually want is that _all_ window heights and widths are adapted, so
that the proportions of the windows remain constant.

This plugin defines a |:ProportionalResize| command that wraps Ex commands
like >
    :set lines=40 columns=80
    :simalt ~m
    :Fullscreen
and scales the window sizes to the new dimensions. It also records the window
layout during brief pauses and is then able to auto-adapt after spontaneous
resizings through the mouse or window manager.

==============================================================================
USAGE						    *ProportionalResize-usage*
							 *:ProportionalResize*
:ProportionalResize {resize-cmd}
			Execute {resize-cmd} (e.g. :setlocal lines=40) and
			adapt the proportions of the current window layout to
			the new size. So if for example you have 3 windows
			split vertically 1:1:2, and a horizontal split 4:1,
			the proportions will be kept instead of the rightmost
			and bottom windows getting all the space increases.
						       *:NoProportionalResize*
:NoProportionalResize {resize-cmd}
			Execute {resize-cmd} (e.g. :setlocal lines=40) without
			adapting the proportions of the current window layout.
			You can wrap commands which would confuse the plugin's
			algorithm (e.g. a rotate function that switches
			vertical with horizontal windows), so that it won't
			automatically adapt the window layout.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				     *ProportionalResize-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ProportionalResize*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				     *ProportionalResize-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.3 or higher and the +float feature.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.000 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				    *ProportionalResize-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					   *g:ProportionalResize_RecordEvents*
The plugin can also handle spontaneous resizings (i.e. when you simply use the
mouse or your window manager's controls to resize the GVIM application / Vim
terminal window). For that, it needs to record the original window
proportions. By default, that is done whenever you pause operation
(|CursorHold|). If you're too impatient, you can add additional events (but
balance that with the drag on performance), e.g. |WinEnter|: >
    let g:ProportionalResize_RecordEvents = 'CursorHold,CursorHoldI,WinEnter'
If you don't want this auto-adaptation at all, and only use the
|:ProportionalResize| wrapper: >
    let g:ProportionalResize_RecordEvents = ''
<					     *g:ProportionalResize_UpdateTime*
To make the auto-adaptation react faster, the plugin decreases the
'updatetime' option temporarily while Vim is being resized. To influence the
delay, modify: >
    let g:ProportionalResize_UpdateTime = 500
<
==============================================================================
INTEGRATION				      *ProportionalResize-integration*

If you have any plugins or mappings that alter the size of the Vim window
(e.g. a |:Fullscreen| or |:Maximize| command) it's advisable to trigger it
through the |:ProportionalResize| wrapper.

LIMITATIONS				      *ProportionalResize-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS				   *ProportionalResize-known-problems*

TODO						     *ProportionalResize-todo*

- Adapt all tab pages, not just the current one. For :ProportionalResize, we
  can do this with :tabdo, but for the auto-adaptation, it cannot be recorded
  that easily.

HISTORY						  *ProportionalResize-history*

1.01	23-May-2014
- Add :NoProportionalResize command.
- BUG: Always restore the original 'updatetime' option value after the resize.
  Otherwise, the lower value may persist, e.g. when the "Stale window
  dimensions record" error is given.
